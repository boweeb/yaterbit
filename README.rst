*WARNING* -- This was an ancient toy project that hasn't seen real development since 2015.
Basically, it shouldn't be relevant to anyone, maybe even myself.
Actually, there's basically no novel code here anyway -- it's little more than the output of a cookiecutter.
Unless I find unpushed code on an older machine, I see no value in keeping this repo.
Archiving it for now, but I'll consider deleting it entirely.
